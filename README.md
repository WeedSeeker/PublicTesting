WeedSeeker Public Testing
=========================


Love WeedSeeker? Want to work with us? Or just hate to see buggy sites on the internet?

This is the place for you.

## Who are us?

We're a startup that connects registered medical marijuana patients to registered growers or sellers.

The patient types a strain name (the variety of marijuana, for those not initiated) or symptom and the site connects them to sellers or growers so they can contact those patients (we call them seekers).

## What do we want with a GitHub repository?

We have a staging site, at [http://alpha.weedseeker.net][1]. The goal of this repository is to create [Selenium WebDriver](2) tests, written in [C#][3], using [NUnit 3][4] and [Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition][5] (which is FREE, but if you have the full version, it's up to you to use it) to excercise our website.

All the tests here and the tests you agree to send here must be licensed with the [MIT License][6]. If this is your trial assignment, please keep on reading this.

## This is my trial assignment. What should I do?

1. First of all, you should create an account and explore the [alpha site][1].
2. Then you can read the tests we already have in our GitHub repo, run them, and look for opportunities of improvement. You may either improve an existing test, fix something that is wrong, or create new tests as you judge necessary.
3. Write your tests. Commit, and when you're ready, create a pull request for us. Your pull request is your deliverable, so make sure you send us anything you judge important, such as your LinkedIn profile, other interesting code you wrote, and so on.

The bottomline is: you're free to send us whatever you wish, but you will only be hired if you match the standards for the position we're hiring, so think wisely when submitting your pull request.

### Important Note

Please remember that the tests are licensed by the [MIT license][6]. So if you send a pull request, the code you're pushing is also licensed by that license.


FAQ
===

## I failed my trial assignment. May I keep creating pull requests?

Please do it. If we see the quality of your work improved, you'll be considered for hiring whenever a position is available.

## But I want to be a developer. Why is my trial an automated test?

In WeedSeeker, there's no such thing as a tester who doesn't write code or a programmer who doesn't write test. Everyone is a Software Engineer, and everyone MUST know how to test one's own code.

## But I don't smoke weed, should I apply anyway?

I don't smoke either, but I believe the world will be a better place if those who do were free to do it. So, if you believe so, you'll be very welcome on our team.
